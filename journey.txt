Favorite Coding temple moment:
    as of 2/8/24 i have been doing this for 8 days so i don't have 
    one

Tooltime: which text editor have you been loving at Coding Temple?
    VS code has been the best for me

Dive Deep: what makes git checkout -b so handy?
    what makes it so handy is that creates a new branch while also
    switching to it.

    making changes to see what happens when i pr on github, 
    trying to create a conflict, was succesful.
    currently editing text from github PR

    merged CT-feature with main, now i will be deleting
    feature branch as well as testing-b becasue i figured
    out what " git checkout -b" does.
